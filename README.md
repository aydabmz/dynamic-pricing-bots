# Dynamic Pricing Bots – Python Project

This repository contains a student project developed during the Python Programming course (Summer Semester 2025) at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Chair of Production and Logistics Planning.

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to develop two pricing algorithms for a simulated market:

- **Monopol-Bot**: Operates in a monopoly setting without competitors. It adjusts prices based on sales history, estimated demand, and inventory pressure.
- **Oligopol-Bot**: Competes in a market with other bots. It analyzes competitor pricing, identifies undercutting patterns, and responds dynamically to maintain competitiveness.

Both bots aim to maximize profit over an unknown number of rounds, with a limited inventory and incomplete information. The pricing logic includes market exploration, bluff strategies, and adaptive price control.

## Files Included

- `Monopol_Bot.py`: Python code for the monopoly scenario
- `Oligopol_Bot.py`: Python code for the oligopoly scenario
- `Monopol_Oligopol_Bots_Description.pdf`: A written report (in German) explaining the logic and structure behind the bots  
  *Note: This report is not a formal academic paper — it is meant to support understanding of the approach.*

## Team

- Ayda Beiram Zadeh  
- Melisa Mavric  

With special thanks to Prof. Dr. Rouven Schur and Kai Winheller from the University of Duisburg-Essen for their valuable support and feedback.

## Learning Goals

- Apply Python to build rule-based pricing algorithms  
- Understand pricing dynamics in monopoly and oligopoly settings  
- Handle uncertainty and limited information in strategic decision-making
